# 🚗 Shared Vehicle Functionality in Multiple Environments

## 🧩 Overview
This repository showcases the **QA validation process** performed on the **booking flow**, **payment integration**, and **vehicle rental features** of the **Urban Routes** application.  
The objective of this project was to apply structured **test case design**, **cross-browser validation**, and **defect tracking** to ensure consistency, accuracy, and alignment with business and UI requirements.

---

## 🔍 Project Scope

### 🧪 Test Checklist & Test Case Design
Created and executed detailed **test checklists** and **manual test cases** for:
- Booking forms  
- Payment method workflows  
- Vehicle rental functionality  

All scenarios were derived from project requirements and **Figma-based UI prototypes** to ensure both functional and visual consistency.

---

### 🌐 Cross-Browser Validation
Conducted functional and UI tests across multiple environments to identify layout discrepancies and behavior deviations:
- **Google Chrome** – Resolution: *800x600*  
- **Mozilla Firefox** – Resolution: *1920x1080*  

This ensured that the core user interactions and responsive elements performed correctly under various display settings.

---

### 🐞 Defect Logging & Tracking
Documented all identified defects in **Jira**, linking each bug to its corresponding test case.  
Each report included **clear reproduction steps**, **expected vs. actual results**, and **screenshots** for better traceability and developer collaboration.
